# IMBD_Actors_SNA_R
I was given a SNA project which I had to answer some questions regarding network metrics such as degree distribution, diameter and average path lengths and node importance with different measures (degree, betweenness and closeness). Also, I was able to conduct some community detection with Louvain clustering.
